It has been approximately one month since I put up my first post on my blog. So, I suppose it is about time for a quick recap for the time passed.

During this one month, I have had a few ideas popped up that could be made some good blog posts, like

* A Hunt for the Wild
* Auto-Silo
* Just, Legal, and Righteous

and a few more that did not survive long enough for a name. I had some rough images on how these ideas, especially the named ones, should be like, and have some bullet point notes and even short paragraphs in my idea book. Yet, once again my inability to write stopped me from developing them wholly. Perhaps one day when I got through my block I would revisit these ideas again.

And, rather than writing a new blog post, I actually took down the first post and only replaced its content with something bearable not too long ago. Hopefully this would be the last time I feel the need to do this.
