Hello, world.

I suppose I cannot keep running away from it.

There are always things in my mind that I want to write down as words, yet after all these times the ideas never managed to manifest themselves outside my head. Often these ideas are just not interesting enough nor important enough. Perhaps I simply do not feel comfortable writing them down. Yet more frequently, for not being good with words, I just cannot find an appropriate way to express these flows of thoughts in lines of words that fully capture what I want to say, even when these ideas and emotions are waiting to come out.

Perhaps long time ago I should have started writing them down anyway, just like this is some kind of exercise or rehabilitation. Even if these thoughts are but my own incoherent mutterings. Even if these words are written for no one but myself.
