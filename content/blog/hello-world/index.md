Hello, world.

I suppose I cannot keep running away from it.

I always have something in my mind that I want to write down in words. Yet, after all these times, these ideas never managed to manifest themselves outside my head. Oftentimes, these ideas are just not interesting nor important enough. Or I simply do not feel comfortable writing them down. With my limited ability with words, I just cannot find an appropriate way to express these flows of thoughts in lines of words that fully capture what I want to say, even when these ideas and emotions are just waiting to be set free.

Perhaps I should have started writing them down anyway long time ago, as if this is some kind of exercise or rehabilitation. Even if these thoughts are but my own incoherent mutterings. Even if these words are not meant for anyone but myself.
